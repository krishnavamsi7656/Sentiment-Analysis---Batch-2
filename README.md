# Sentiment-Analysis---Batch-2 (JNTUH-UCES)

This Project deals with analysing the user given text reviews and understanding them which a machine does with the help of NLP and ML techniques.
We basically tried to reduce the problem of manual coding where a group of people sit together to analyse a product's review. 
Our main advantage is that here with the help of this project we are able to help both customers and product launching companies.
We have used SVM Classifier and have done training and testing on the datasets.
